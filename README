Simple python script that scrapes a SmarTrip user's transit usage data from WMATA website (http://smartrip.wmata.com)
Script authenticates into WMATA website using Mechanize library and then extracts data from HTML tables using Beautiful Soup library then writes lovely clean CSV files.

*IMPORTANT* To run this code, use python CABIscraper.py -u <username> -p <password>

Enjoy!
